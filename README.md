# Fill in the Blanks: Image Enhancement using GANs and Deep Image Prior

In response to the challenges posed by poor internet connectivity during the pandemic, this project aims to develop a solution to enhance video quality in real-time during video conferencing. The approach involves utilizing Image Inpainting and Denoising techniques with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the Deep Image Prior model. This solution can be seamlessly integrated into existing video conferencing applications, offering an improved video experience for users.
